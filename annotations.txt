- efficient compiling (not take minutes to compile a code when you want to test)
- efficient execution
- easy to code

- strong, static type system (everything has a type)
- C inspired syntax
- compiled (we need to compile the code to execute)
- multi paradigm (object oriented, struct programming, imperative programming. It all up to you)
- garbage collected (process that deletes data that not using anymore. No one is pointing at memory space, so it's deleted)
- creates a single binary compilation (when compile, creates one file. One executable output for code)
- new versions will be always fully backwards compatible(new version is compatible with the previous versions..).
